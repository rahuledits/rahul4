## **How to Fix: Enable SPA Routing**

### **If you are using Netlify:**
1. In your project’s `public` folder, create a file called `_redirects` (no extension).
2. Add this line to the file:
   ```
   /*    /index.html   200
   ```
3. Deploy your site again.

### **If you are using Vercel:**
- Add a `vercel.json` file with the following:
  ```json
  {
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
    ]
  }
  ```

### **If you are using your own server:**
- Make sure all unknown routes serve `index.html`.

## **Test After Fixing**
1. Deploy your changes.
2. Visit `https://itsrahuledits.live/contact` directly in your browser.  
   - If you see your site (not a 404), it’s fixed!
3. Go back to Google Search Console and **Request Indexing** again.

## Why Your Site Might Not Appear Yet

1. **Indexing Takes Time**
   - After submitting your sitemap and requesting indexing, it can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks for Google to crawl and index your site.
   - New domains and new content often take longer to appear.

2. **Site Age & Authority**
   - New websites (especially new domains) take longer to show up in search results because Google needs to “trust” them.
   - As your site gets older and gets more visitors/backlinks, it will appear more quickly.

3. **No Backlinks Yet**
   - If no other sites link to yours, Google may crawl it less frequently.
   - Backlinks from other reputable sites help Google discover and trust your site.

4. **Low Content or Thin Content**
   - If your site has very little content, or mostly images with little text, Google may not rank it highly.
   - Add more detailed text content, especially on your homepage and about page.

5. **Search Query Specifics**
   - If you search for very generic terms, your site may not appear yet.
   - Try searching for your exact domain (e.g., `site:itsrahuledits.live` in Google) to see if it’s indexed.

## What You Should Do Next

### 1. **Check Indexing Status**
- Go to Google and search:  
  ```
  site:itsrahuledits.live
  ```
- If you see your pages, they are indexed. If not, they are still waiting to be crawled.

### 2. **Keep Monitoring Google Search Console**
- Check for any errors or warnings.
- See if your pages are listed under “Pages” as “Indexed.”

### 3. **Add More Content**
- Write more about yourself, your services, and your projects.
- Add a blog or news section if possible.

### 4. **Get Backlinks**
- Share your site on social media, forums, or with friends.
- Ask others to link to your site.

### 5. **Be Patient**
- For new sites, it’s normal to wait 1–4 weeks (sometimes longer) for first appearance in search.
